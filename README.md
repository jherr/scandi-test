# Following issues were discovered in this repository

1. Folder `plugins` may only contain plugins, which export an object, components, anything else can not be located here. Action: **I will try adding more detailed message about that!**.
2. Extensions can not enable themself - the enabled extension resoltion is recurive - from your application root we scan all enabled extensions up, so it is not reccomended to enable extension in the same extension. Action - **I will try adding an warnign about that**
3. For some reason, potentially for some babel-specific reason the following code: `import React from "react";` and then `React.Component` did not function correctly. Use the `import { Component } from "react";` instead. This is a bug, but I am not sure if I will be able to address it soon enough.
4. Finally and most importantly, the local modules can only by symlinked if their version in `package.json` starts with `link:` and you are using `yarn` or `file:` but then manual symlinking is needed (`yarn link` or `npm link`).
